Tnt Run Minecraft Game in Real Life

## Quickstart

**Start a virtual environment in the terminal**

```bash
python3 -m venv environment_name
```

Once you have the virtual environment you have to activate it.

```bash
source environment_name/bin/activate
```

**_Important to note_**

`.venv` as environment_name would be used.

`python3` depends on how you execute python files on your computer, you can also check also with `python`.

**Install the dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
